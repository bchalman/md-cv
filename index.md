## Currently

I'm a Sales Representative at Chalman Technologies, based out of their office and application lab in Anaheim, CA. Here I develop and manage sale opportunities for many equipment suppliers, covering assembly, test, and rework equipment for hybrid electronics and material processing for general manufacturing.
